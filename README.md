## Reflection Questions

1.How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
This made the coding process much easier, because styling is probably the most difficult and tedious however, having the styles established for me not only made it quicker but much easier to understand. 

2.What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
The parts that I found the most difficult were spacing options and better understanding the padding verses margins in order to have the images properly spaced and away from the top.

3.How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?
The feedback from Frontend mentor can help by giving assistance or suggestions on ways to make our code more organized, concise, or easier. It also serves as an opportunity to not be stuck in our ways when coding and recognizing multiple paths to do the same thing.
